    <p>
        Two paths lie before you—one of shadow, 
        one of sun. Both lead to destiny, but only you can choose the road to walk.

            <h4>The Pyramids</h4>
            <p> 
                The pyramid looms before you, its ancient stones glowing faintly 
                beneath the moonlight. Inside, narrow corridors twist like a labyrinth, 
                every step echoing with the weight of forgotten ages. 
                Hieroglyphs stare from the walls, warning of those who dare to seek what lies within. 
                The deeper you go, the colder the air becomes, until you reach a vast chamber 
                where gold gleams in the torchlight. Yet the silence feels alive, as if 
                the very walls are waiting—guarding a treasure that was never meant to be touched.

            <h4>The Desert</h4>
            <p>
                The desert swallows the horizon, its endless dunes shimmering under the relentless sun. 
                Each step feels heavier, as if the sands themselves wish to keep you lost. But then, 
                half-buried beneath the shifting grains, you uncover a worn piece of parchment. 
                The map's ink glows faintly, tracing paths across the desert like guiding stars. 
                With it in your hands, the dunes no longer seem endless—the way forward, and the way out,
                has been revealed.
